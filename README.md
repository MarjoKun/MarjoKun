<h1>Hi, I'm Mariusz but everyone calls me Marjo!</h1>
<h1>Unity C# Programmer</h1>

<h2>About me:</h2>
For 5.5 years I have worked for company which main focus were VR/AR applications for clients. I have been working on plenty of projects with different technologies and challenges, every new project was different from previous one. Because of that I was able to learn a lot about programming, different technologies and SDK, approaches, contacts with clients, programming patterns, project management, documentations, diagrams and a lot more. My journey was long and full of adventures.
